# MPI & OpenMP Scalability Practice – MSU VMK 2024

This repository contains practice projects for the course on **Scalability of Parallel Programs**, held at the **Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics (VMK), Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU)** in 2024. The course is organized by the **Department of Supercomputers and Quantum Informatics**.

## Description

The projects in this repository demonstrate practical aspects of scalability for parallel applications using:

- **MPI (Message Passing Interface)** for distributed memory parallelism
- **OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing)** for shared memory parallelism

These projects are intended for benchmarking, analyzing, and understanding the scalability of algorithms on multi-core and multi-node systems.

## Contents

- `MPI/` – MPI-based scalability project
- `OpenMP/` – OpenMP-based scalability project   
- `Architecture/` – Architecture-issues scalability project  

## Requirements

- C/C++ compiler with MPI and OpenMP support (e.g., `mpicc`, `gcc`, or `clang`)
- A multi-core or cluster environment for scalability tests
